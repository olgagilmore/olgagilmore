Throughout my career I have acquired a very diversified skill set and worked with many tools and technologies. I’m an eager learner and fearless adopter of new ideas. As an engineer, I love to use them to solve problems at hand. Recently I implemented a java-based testing framework for our MRY product with an innovative deployment and reporting solution. I also took an initiative to create several Python and Linux scripts to automate critical tests, and then developed a Spring Boot web application for uploading locomotive messages directly to our IBM MQ queues and micro-service based apps.

This year I dove even deeper into expanding my technical skills and earned three Nano-degree programs from Udacity: 
 - ✏ full-stack web-developer, 
 - ✏ algorithms and data structures, 
 - ✏ and Java web developer Nano-degree. 

This project-based learning allowed me to practice hands on the innumerable new technologies including Docker, Kubernetes, deployment to AWS, data persistence, Hibernate, Graph QL, security and devOps, and more.
